# This file contains the contact information for repositories exposed through
# the Sunstone registry. Each repository has an alias, a url to a file and
# one or more maintainers.
#
# The structure of the repositories object is:
# repositories:
#  - alias: example
#    url: https://example.com/deployment.yaml
#    maintainers:

# Note, for the email address it is acceptable to have a mailing list for a team
# because projects often have multiple people who may rotate on the team.
